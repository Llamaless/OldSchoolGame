# OldSchoolGame
Group project for the Old School Game group A1

Expectations for the game:

Kobe -  
As a player, I would like to have enemies to fight.
As a player, I would like to have an inventory so I know what I’m carrying. 
As a player, I would expect there to be some form of linear story.
As a player, I would like some form of interaction to add to the story. 


Deen -
I would like for the user to progress through the story line by choosing different options.
I would like the user to be able to choose their class at the beginning of the story.
I would like for there to be many different scenarios based on the options the user chooses.
Lastly there should be a small amount of graphics to be implemented in the text based game.
