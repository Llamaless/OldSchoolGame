# OldSchoolGame
Group project for the Old School Game group A1
Expectations for the game:
Kobe -  As a player, I would like to have enemies to fight.
        As a player, I would like to have an inventory so I know what I’m carrying. 
        As a player, I would expect there to be some form of linear story.
        As a player, I would like some form of interaction to add to the story.
