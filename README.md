# OldSchoolGame
Group project for the Old School Game group A1

Expectations for the game:

Kobe -  
As a player, I would like to have enemies to fight.
As a player, I would like to have an inventory so I know what I’m carrying. 
As a player, I would expect there to be some form of linear story.
As a player, I would like some form of interaction to add to the story.
