As a player, I would like some form of interaction to add to the story. 


Deen -
I would like for the user to progress through the story line by choosing different options.
I would like the user to be able to choose their class at the beginning of the story.
I would like for there to be many different scenarios based on the options the user chooses.
Lastly there should be a small amount of graphics to be implemented in the text based game.

Osama-

As as player, i would like to have multiple options at each step(3 or more) where each option has different effect on score.
As in one option has higher score than the other one or it can lead to even some deduction in score.
